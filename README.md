## About me
Hello ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Alexander Mosin and I am a full-stack developer from Moscow. My goal is to become part of an IT team and develop in the field of web development.    
I have been programming since childhood. I studied Basic, Delphi, Php, JavaScript on my own. But I was always drawn to web development. That is why I started making websites first on CMS such as Joomla and WordPress.  
Then I decided to do web development professionally, so I studied the stack of technologies for layout (HTML, CSS, SCSS, Pug) and, accordingly, for giving sites interactivity and dynamism (TypeScript, React, Vue).
I also studied the backend component of web site development (Node.js, Express, NestJS).  
I have experience in building application architecture, including the MVP approach, as well as experience working with relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases, CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and deploying projects via Docker and Nginx.
The full stack of my knowledge can be viewed in the corresponding section.  
I completed Yandex Practicum Courses in the specialty of full-stack developer and have a corresponding diploma.  

P.S.  
I love learning new technologies and am always happy to collaborate!
